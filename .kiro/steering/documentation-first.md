# Documentation-First Approach

When working with AWS services, libraries, or frameworks:
- Check official documentation first before making assumptions
- Use web_search for current service specifications and best practices
- Verify API signatures and parameters against official sources
- Reference documentation when suggesting configurations or implementations
